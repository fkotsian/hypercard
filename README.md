#HyperCard
Next-generation flashcard software for learners.
- Spacing mode (optimizes your forgetting curve)
- Mnemonics (the rhyme and reason to your topics)
- Anchors (add images to enhance your memory)

Using the science of context and memory integration, HyperCard aims to provide you with flashcards that will make things stick in your brain. We recommend how often to study, show you what you need to review, and create mental anchors that relate what you know to what you need to learn. Think of us as your personal memory assistant - with a big (memory) bazooka.
